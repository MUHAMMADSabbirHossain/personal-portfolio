                <p className='text-xl'>Based on the Tailwind CSS utility classes, ComponentsUI's prebuilt components and UI elements help you quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first websites with diverse predefined components (such as modals, buttons, alerts, cards and more).</p>

                <p className='text-xl'>Components are grouped by visual usability criteria (components, navigation, forms, etc.) and styled directly on top of Tailwind CSS, making them easy to extend and customize. This is a lifesaver for developers looking to create a unique and eye-catching design system without the hassle of creating each component by hand.</p>
